  <em>Transitioning into Computer Science | Self-Taught Dev & CS Student (from Fall 2025)</em>

<br>

At 35, I decided to pursue a lifelong passion for technology. After years of working in other fields and raising two kids, I’m now making a career change that truly matters to me: I'll be starting a **part-time Computer Science degree** in Fall 2025.

To learn more about what motivated me to take this step, see: [**"Making the Leap: Why I’m Finally Studying Computer Science."**]()

<br>

Despite limited time, I taught myself during the last few months:

</p>

My approach is hands-on: I learn by building and sharing my journey. I believe real growth happens when we stop hiding behind perfection(ism) and start showing our progress. That's why I build this page and why I’m sharing all my learning projects **here on GitHub**:

### 💡 My Philosophy

```text
“Progress over perfection.”

I learn by doing — building things, breaking things, writing about the process, and sharing the journey.  
My goal is not to be flawless but to be consistent and curious.
```
